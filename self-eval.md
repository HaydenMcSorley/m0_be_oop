# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
# It was very tough, but rewarding once everything started to click. Also had a lot of help from the small group and Aurora in studyhall which helped me finish the assignment.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
# Could definitely be better about staying focused but I think getting my work station in my room instead of out in the middle of the house will help with that. I do need to take more scheduled breaks because I either forget to take breaks or I'm away from my computer for like 20 minutes at a time which throws off the flow.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
# Not to over complicate things in my head. Often times what I was stressing out over was extremely simple, but I couldn't convince myself that it could actually be that easy. Also Aurora mentioned a tool called pry that I want to familiarize myself with before the start of mod 1.
